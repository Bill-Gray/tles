#
#    The following TLEs (Two-Line Elements) were generated by fitting
# a numerically-integrated ephemeris,  based on the orbit given below,
# to the SDP4/SGP4 models.  Each TLE is good for the interval between
# its epoch and the epoch of the subsequent TLE (usually one day).
# The maximum deviation between the numerically integrated ephemerides
# and the TLE-based ephemeris, in kilometers,  is given for each TLE
# as the "worst residual".
#
#    This fitting is done using the 'eph2tle' code packaged with Find_Orb.
# The code has details on how the TLEs were computed :
#
#    https://github.com/Bill-Gray/find_orb/eph2tle.cpp
#
#    Be warned:  the error given is that between the numerically
# integrated ephems and the TLE model.  There will usually be at
# least some additional difference between the ephems and the actual
# motion of the satellite,  especially if the ephemerides are based
# on a short arc.  If the following orbital elements say something
# like "[based on] 10 observations 2015 Jan. 1-13",  and the TLEs
# are for 2015 May,  the extrapolation may be tenuous at best.  If
# your application requires a specific level of accuracy,  you may
# want to contact me;  I can give you some idea as to the fit of the
# underlying data (and possibly TLEs based on newer data).
#
#   You can usually find the underlying observational data,  and the
# fitted orbit,  residuals,  ephemerides,  and sometimes some comments
# about the object,  among the pages listed at
#
#    https://www.projectpluto.com/pluto/mpecs/pseudo.htm
#
#    Also,  if you use a TLE outside the "correct" time range (between
# its MJD and that of the next TLE),  all bets are off.  I've carefully
# computed and minimized the worst error over the "correct" time frame,
# but the ephemeris may (or may not) diverge wildly outside of it.

#
#  BACKGROUND
#   Intuitive Machine's Nova-C class IM-1 lunar lander "Odysseus" launched
#   February 15, 2024 @ 06:05 UTC from LC-39A at Cape Canaveral (USA) on a
#   SpaceX Falcon 9.
#
#   It will be the first commercial lunar lander by a private company, and was
#   selected through NASA's CLPS initiative.
#
#   It is planned to land on the Moon about 9 days after launch (~Feb 24) and
#   operate for about 7 days after touchdown, until lunar night begins at the
#   lunar south pole landing site, about 300 km from the south pole at crater
#   Malapert A. This is close to the Malapert Massif, a candidate landing zone
#   for NASA's Artemis III mission.
#
#   The Falcon 9 second stage will place the spacecraft into a 185 x 60000 km
#   Earth orbit. After ~35 minutes of coasting, the second stage will then propel
#   Odysseus into a Trans-Lunar Orbit (TLO) intercepting the Moon's orbit.
#
#   Deployment of the spacecraft is to occur 48 minutes and 24 seconds after
#   launch when the second stage will use spring force to push the lander away.
#
#   Odysseus will make three small adjustment burns en route before the TLO
#   trajectory takes IM-1 behind the Moon. The main engine autonomous Lunar
#   Orbit Injection (LOI) burn will place Odysseus into a near-circular 100-km
#   Low-Lunar Orbit.
#
#   Throughout twelve 2-hour long orbits of the Moon, checks of all spacecraft
#   systems will be completed before committing to a lunar descent.
#
#   The autonomous Descent Orbit Burn will take place on the far side of the
#   Moon and reduce the craft's orbit to 10 kilometers above the landing site.
#   The craft will then coast for an hour before powered descent.
#
#   The Nova-C class main engine is designed to burn continuously throughout the
#   powered descent. The lander will be slowed by 1,800 meters per second, then
#   pitched over to assume landing attitude when 30 meters above the lunar
#   surface, before bringing the craft to a soft landing.
#
#  PURPOSE
#   The mission' primary objective is to deliver a variety of payloads to the
#   Moon's south pole region, a part of the Moon that remains unexplored and is
#   a target for later NASA Artemis manned missions.  These payloads include
#   scientific instruments and technology demonstrations that aim to inform
#   future human and robotic exploration of the Moon.
