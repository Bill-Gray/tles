#   This object (the Queqiao lunar communations relay satellite) will
# presumably be staying at the earth-moon L2 point.  The following TLEs
# are just for its ascent to the moon,  so these TLEs won't be updated.
# The following line should keep 'sat_id' from nagging you to update :
#
# No updates
#
#    The following TLEs (Two-Line Elements) were generated by fitting
# a numerically-integrated ephemeris,  based on the orbit given below,
# to the SDP4/SGP4 models.  Each TLE is good for the interval between
# its epoch and the epoch of the subsequent TLE (usually one day).
# The maximum deviation between the numerically integrated ephemerides
# and the TLE-based ephemeris, in kilometers,  is given for each TLE
# as the "worst residual".
#
#    This fitting is done using the 'eph2tle' code packaged with Find_Orb.
# The code has details on how the TLEs were computed :
#
#    https://github.com/Bill-Gray/find_orb/eph2tle.cpp
#
#    Be warned:  the error given is that between the numerically
# integrated ephems and the TLE model.  There will usually be at
# least some additional difference between the ephems and the actual
# motion of the satellite,  especially if the ephemerides are based
# on a short arc.  If the following orbital elements say something
# like "[based on] 10 observations 2015 Jan. 1-13",  and the TLEs
# are for 2015 May,  the extrapolation may be tenuous at best.  If
# your application requires a specific level of accuracy,  you may
# want to contact me;  I can give you some idea as to the fit of the
# underlying data (and possibly TLEs based on newer data).
#
# Queqiao just went in a simple Hohmann-like transfer from low-earth
# orbit to a lunar flyby.  These TLEs give its position over four
# days;  after that,  it'll maneuver into an orbit behind the moon
# at the earth-moon L2 point.  So these are the only TLEs it'll have.
# (At least,  until it runs out of stationkeeping fuel and falls into
# a geocentric orbit.)
#
#    Also,  if you use a TLE outside the "correct" time range (between
# its epoch and that of the next epoch),  all bets are off.  It usually
# seems to be a decent fit,  at least for a while,  but I don't
# recommend doing it.
