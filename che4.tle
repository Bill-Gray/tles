# UPDATED to reflect the actual launch time (18:23 UTC on Dec 7)
# and expected time of orbit insertion at the moon (about 15:00 UTC
# on Dec 11).
#
#    NOTE:  These TLEs may be hilariously wrong.  The problem is that
# I'm reasonably sure Chang'e 4 was launched at 18:23 UTC on
# December 7,  and was inserted into an orbit from a point roughly
# opposite where the moon would be at 15:00 UTC on the 11th.  But
# I'm not entirely sure I've got the direction right,  and really have
# almost no way to tell.  I do think it'll be pretty good as the object
# approaches the moon.  That end is somewhat more tightly constrained.
#
#    Once I got a suitable trajectory,  I computed a numerically
# integrated ephemeris (well,  I did that as part of getting the
# suitable trajectory) and fitted TLEs much as I normally would,
# to the SDP4/SGP4 models.  Each TLE is good for the interval between
# its epoch and the epoch of the subsequent TLE (half a day,  in this
# case). The maximum deviation between the numerically integrated
# ephemerides and the TLE-based ephemeris, in kilometers,  is given
# for each TLE as the "worst residual".
#
#    This fitting is done using the 'eph2tle' code packaged with Find_Orb.
# The code has details on how the TLEs were computed :
#
#    https://github.com/Bill-Gray/find_orb/eph2tle.cpp
#
#    Be warned:  the error given is that between the numerically
# integrated ephems and the TLE model.  In this case,  that fit is
# pretty good.  But we don't actually know that the direction I came
# up with is right.  I'm proceeding based on first principles and
# guesswork.
#
#    Also,  if you use a TLE outside the "correct" time range (between
# its MJD and that of the next TLE),  all bets are off.  I've carefully
# computed and minimized the worst error over the "correct" time frame,
# but the ephemeris may (or may not) diverge wildly outside of it.
