# UPDATED to reflect the actual launch time
#
#    NOTE:  These TLEs may be hilariously wrong.  They are based on
# the assumption that Chang'e 4 was launched at 18:23 UTC on
# December 7,  and proceeded straight east,  shutting down its
# engines at a point that will let it coast up to the moon.  When
# it gets there,  the moon will be at about declination -17.3.  I
# found a point where a launch from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center,
# starting out due east,  would "bend" down to latitude 17.3.  I
# then looked for a trajectory that would go from there to a prograde
# flyby of the moon 100 km above its surface.  Lots of assumptions
# there.  This matches what our friends in China did for Queqiao,
# and (as best I can tell from limited data) Chang'es 2 and 3.
#
#    One cause for concern here is that this trajectory requires almost
# six days (!) to get to the moon,  with perilune at 19:00 UT on
# 13 December.  However,  this Planetary Society blog post :
#
# http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2018/20180615-queqiao-orbit-explainer.html
#
# has an interesting "lunar swing-by to Earth-Moon L2" diagram
# about a third of the way down.  This looks to be an excellent
# match.  The diagram specifies a 140-hour transfer time.  The
# orbit I've found is 144.5 hours.
#
#    Once I got a suitable trajectory,  I computed a numerically
# integrated ephemeris (well,  I did that as part of getting the
# suitable trajectory) and fitted TLEs much as I normally would,
# to the SDP4/SGP4 models.  Each TLE is good for the interval between
# its epoch and the epoch of the subsequent TLE (half a day,  in this
# case). The maximum deviation between the numerically integrated
# ephemerides and the TLE-based ephemeris, in kilometers,  is given
# for each TLE as the "worst residual".
#
#    This fitting is done using the 'eph2tle' code packaged with Find_Orb.
# The code has details on how the TLEs were computed :
#
#    https://github.com/Bill-Gray/find_orb/eph2tle.cpp
#
#    Be warned:  the error given is that between the numerically
# integrated ephems and the TLE model.  In this case,  that fit is
# pretty good.  But we don't actually know that the launch will occur
# at 18:15 UTC on December 7,  or if it will proceed as I'm assuming
# based almost entirely on first principles and guesswork.
#
#    Also,  if you use a TLE outside the "correct" time range (between
# its MJD and that of the next TLE),  all bets are off.  I've carefully
# computed and minimized the worst error over the "correct" time frame,
# but the ephemeris may (or may not) diverge wildly outside of it.
