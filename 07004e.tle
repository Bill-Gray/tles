#
#    The following TLEs (Two-Line Elements) were generated by fitting
# numerically-integrated ephemerides from the OEM_CARA files at
#
# http://soleil.ssl.berkeley.edu/ground_systems/products/THEMIS/THEMIS_E/
#
# to the SDP4/SGP4 models.  Each TLE is good for the interval between
# its epoch and the epoch of the subsequent TLE (usually one day).
# The maximum deviation between the numerically integrated ephemerides
# and the TLE-based ephemeris, in kilometers,  is given for each TLE
# as the "worst residual".
#
#    The above site gives data covering about 18 days.  These TLEs will
# be updated every week or so to keep them au courant.
#
#    Almost all other TLEs on this site were computed from observations.
# I've done that for the Themis objects in the past,  but they maneuver.
# Using the above ephemerides and fitting TLEs to them appears to work
# much better.  (Space-Track TLEs,  as of early 2019,  are junk.)
#
#    If you use a TLE outside the "correct" time range (between its MJD
# and that of the next TLE),  all bets are off.  I've carefully computed
# and minimized the worst error over the "correct" time frame,  but the
# ephemeris may (or may not) diverge wildly outside of it.
#
#    This fitting is done using the 'eph2tle' code packaged with Find_Orb.
# The code has details on how the TLEs were computed :
#
#    https://github.com/Bill-Gray/find_orb/eph2tle.cpp
#
#    Be warned:  the error given is that between the numerically
# integrated ephems and the TLE model.  The THEMIS ephemerides appear
# to be pretty good,  so I think (but am not sure) that in this case,
# the stated errors are close to the real errors.  But if there are
# additional errors,  you should regard the "worst residuals" shown
# below as a lower limit on how bad the TLEs are;  there's no guarantee
# that they aren't actually worse than that.
